# Sample Questions

## Apheresis

**Q: What are some of the possible complications of apheresis? Outline your response in bullet points.**

**A:**
- Hypocalcemia
- Hypotension
- ACE inhibitor reactions
- Transfusion reactions

**Q: How would you change management if a patient with GBS exhibited autonomic instability?**

**A:**
Patients with GBS may benefit from an albumin prebolus to minimize procedure-related hypotension. Therefore, if a patient with GBS exhibits autonomic instability, I would suggest giving the patient a prebolus of 250mL 5% albumin to help manage hypotension.

**Q: What laboratory measurements guide the decision to proceed with apheresis in hereditary hemochromatosis?**

**A:**
Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are used to guide the decision to proceed with apheresis in hereditary hemochromatosis. A persistently elevated serum transferrin saturation of ≥45% and/or unexplained serum ferritin of ≥300 ng/mL in men or ≥200 ng/mL in premenopausal women support a diagnosis of HH.

## Rounds and Procedures

**Q: I have several patients scheduled tomorrow morning at 10AM-Noon for either apheresis or erythrocytopheresis procedure. All patients are admitted. Lines are in. What should I make sure that I do tomorrow morning before rounds?**

**A:**
Before 10AM tomorrow morning, make sure to:
- Pre-round at the bedside of all patients undergoing apheresis or erythrocytopheresis.
- Discuss the cases with the apheresis attending and call the on-call apheresis nurse with patient updates.
- Ensure necessary labs are drawn.
- During rounds, present the outpatients to the attending and follow them on walking rounds.
*Note: Did not list doing consent forms.*

**Q: Please provide names and contact numbers for all transfusion attendings. Who should be contacted for peripheral smears?**

**A:**
The attendings for transfusion include:
- Dr. John Frater: 314-484-6369 (cell), 314-836-1184 (pager), 314-925-8383 (home)
- Dr. Ron Jackups: 314-578-3940
- Dr. Charles Eby: 314-954-1242

For peripheral smears, the HP3 attending should be contacted.

## Emergency Situations

**Q: It is 8:15 PM on a Wednesday and I received a call from the lab about a possible “bug” in a CSF sample. What should I do next?**

**A:**
You should page the Hematology LMR immediately (the after hours and weekend pager will connect to the Transfusion LMR). The LMR may request the slide to be put in Cellavision. The LMR will review the patient chart for history and simultaneous microbiology orders. The LMR will call the Hematology Laboratory Attending in the following order:
- Dr. John Frater: 314-484-6369 (cell), 314-836-1184 (pager), 314-925-8383 (home)
- Dr. Ron Jackups: 314-578-3940
- Dr. Charles Eby: 314-954-1242

*Note: This is consistent with my redbook pdf, which may be out of date.*

**Q: I am the transfusion LMR. It is Wednesday around midnight when I get a page about a transfusion reaction. What signs or findings would warrant immediately calling the transfusion attending on service?**

**A:**
Suspicion for TRALI, bacterial contamination, possible hemolysis, and/or severe reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) necessitates an immediate discussion with the TM attending on call to determine the course of action.

## Anticoagulants

**Q: Which of the listed anticoagulants in the survival guide have the shortest half-lives?**

**A:**
The direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran, argatroban, bivalirudin) have the shortest half-lives, with a half-life of 30-60 minutes when administered intravenously.

*Note: Correct to mention IV because oral dabigatran has a half-life of 12-17 hours.*

## Protocol Amendment

**Q: Please amend the protocol in the section on IgA deficiency to reflect a new cutoff of < 5mg/dl (instead of 25 mg/dl).**

**A:**
The protocol in the section on IgA deficiency should be amended to reflect a new cutoff of < 5mg/dl (instead of 25 mg/dl). Confirm IgA concentration <5 mg/dL using in-house test. If less than <5 mg/dL, send for IgA Deficiency Panel which includes a more sensitive quantitative IgA level and Anti-IgA detection. Check "IgA Deficiency Panel" (403107P) on the requisition and provide 2 mL of serum (red top tube). IgA deficient products require IgA concentrations < 0.05 mg/dL (<1:900 US blood donors).

*Note: Correct... but why did it repeat my question?*

## Carbon Budget

**Q: What do we know about the 2 degrees Celsius carbon budget?**

**A:**
We have already ‘spent’ about 585 billion tonnes (also referred to as gigatonnes) of carbon (Gt C), which reduces the remaining carbon budget to about 415 Gt C. Then we need to account for the other GHGs, principally nitrous oxide and methane. If we don’t reduce them at the same rate as we reduce carbon dioxide, we’ll have less of the budget—about 210 Gt C less—to still ‘spend’. That leaves about 205 Gt C. The current rate of emissions of carbon dioxide is about 10 Gt C per year, so at present rates this remaining budget would be used by about 2040.

Estimating the carbon budget to meet the 2°C Paris target:
- We have already ‘spent’ about 585 billion tonnes (also referred to as gigatonnes) of carbon (Gt C), which reduces the remaining carbon budget to about 415 Gt C.
- Then we need to account for the other GHGs, principally nitrous oxide and methane.
- If we don’t reduce them at the same rate as we reduce carbon dioxide, we’ll have less of the budget—about 210 Gt C less—to still ‘spend’.
- That leaves about 205 Gt C.
