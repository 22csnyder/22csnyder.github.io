  Expenses paid invitation to present at the Texas A&M University Mathematics Department Seminar Series. The talk was sponsored by the Department of Mathematics at A&M, and was hosted by Dr. Boris Hanin. The talk was given on November 13, 2020.


Title of Talk
===
_Inverse Problems and Machine Learning, Combinatorial Complexity of Deep Networks: Think Weight Configurations, not Perturbations!_

Topic of Talk
---
In this talk I presented some of my work on hypothesis class complexity of neural networks from the point of view of combinatorial degrees of freedom, which I observed to decrease with prolonged optimization as an apparent benefit of "overfitting" the training data.

A cellphone picture I took of the department itinerary for the day of my talk. I was very impressed by the organization and the hospitality of the department.
