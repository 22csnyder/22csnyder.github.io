intro: |
  This was the first project I took up in year-1 of medical school. In order to determine the relaxivity of MRI contrast agents, a study was done using phantom specimens and varying concentrations of contrast agent.
  
  I devised an image processing algorithm that extracted the pixel intensities from each of the circular "wells" in the control image."
