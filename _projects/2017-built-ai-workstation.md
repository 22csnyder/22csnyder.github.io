intro: |
  This project was my first experience building computer systems which gave me perspective as the the hardware requirements in AI research systems. I used this computer for the next 3 years for my research and it was a great learning experience.

  Later, several additional copies were purchased based on my design which continue to this day to be used to fulfill compute needs of research labs in the department. (pictured below)
